        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p>When I'm not busy with surgeries and sailing the Grand Line, here are a few things I enjoy:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>New Stuff: </strong> I like reading about medicine even when I'm not in the hospital. It's not just about fixing people; I enjoy learning new things in the medical world.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Sword Practice:</strong> I've got this cool sword named "Kikoku." It's not just for fights; it's like a form of exercise and expression for me.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Exploring New Islands:</strong> As a pirate, I love finding new islands. It's not always about battles; I enjoy checking out different places and meeting new people.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Listening to Music:</strong> Music is my escape. Whether it's a calm tune during quiet times or the lively beats from different islands, it helps me relax and get inspired.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Playing Chess:</strong> I like playing strategic games like chess. It's not just about surgery; I enjoy thinking ahead and planning my moves.
            </li>
        </ul>
